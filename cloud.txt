Cloud Poem

Blue sky,
there are clouds floating.
Or,
are they swimming?

If you look upside down,
then you'll know.

When they are too crowded,
they go dark,
darker and darker,
till some of them starts to cry.

Typhoon is one of us,
some also calls them hurricane.

Wind blows them.
They float about,
sometimes faster,
sometimes slower,
and sometimes they simply chill.

I love clouds.
They are all around me.
Everywhere, every time.
